# SAS
SAS (Static Analysis Suite) is a powerful tool for running static analysis on C++ code. SAS runs in parallel with compilation and as such can run useful and fine-grained checks; currently included are checks for code formatting, naming conventions, thread safety, performance and usage of modern language constructs. SAS is easy to use and supports user-written custom checkers.

SAS wraps the Clang compiler and runs a number of [checkers](documentation/sas_checkers.md), which may be general or project-specific. Any errors found are written to an html file that is displayed in the report index.

Using SAS in continuous integration will help projects to maintain safe, readable and consistent code.

# Documentation
* [Using SAS](documentation/using_sas.md)
* [SAS Checkers](documentation/sas_checkers.md)
* [The HTML Report Index](documentation/report_index.md)

# Prerequisites
The following software is required to run SAS:
* CMake version 2.8 or newer.
* Clang/LLVM version 3.5 or newer.
* Python 2.7 or newer. In order to generate custom checkers from yaml files, the `yaml` module must be installed.

# Quick Start Guide
## Preparing the Environment
On lxplus or any slc6 system at CERN, run the following commands to setup the required environment:
```
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/llvm/3.6/x86_64-slc6/setup.sh
source /afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/views/LCG_85/x86_64-slc6-gcc49-opt/setup.sh
```
## <a id="buildingAndInstalling"></a> Building and Installing SAS
Clone the SAS repository and run the following:
```
export SASBUILDDIR=[name for build directory]
export SASINSTALLDIR=[name for install directory]
export LLVM_DEV_DIR=[name of LLVM dev directory]
mkdir $SASINSTALLDIR
mkdir $SASBUILDDIR;cd $SASBUILDDIR
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="../$SASINSTALLDIR" ../SAS
make install
```
replacing the square-bracketed terms with approprate names.

This installs SAS with the default checkers (general coding conventions, thread-safety and performance) enabled.

The following CMake options can be used to enable further checkers:
* `-DFCCSW_CHECKERS=ON`: enable FCCSW naming convention checkers (see [FCCSW documentation](https://github.com/jlingema/FCCSW/blob/master/doc/CppCodingStyleGuidelines.md))
* `-DROOT_CHECKERS=ON`: enable ROOT naming convention checkers (see [ROOT/Taligent documentation](https://root.cern.ch/TaligentDocs/TaligentOnline/DocumentRoot/1.0/Docs/books/WM/WM_63.html))
* `-DEXAMPLE_CHECKERS=ON`: enable the example checker (checks that variable names begin with a capital letter)

##<a id="usingSAS"></a>Using SAS
For more detailed SAS options and alternative ways to run SAS, see the [Using SAS](documentation/using_sas.md) section of the documentation.

The simplest way to run SAS is through CMake. Within the project directory, run the command
```
export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:$SASINSTALLDIR
```
to set the cmake prefix path, and then add the lines
```
find_package(sas)
enable_sas()
```
to the project's `CMakeLists.txt` after the `project()` command to enable sas. This replaces the C++ compiler with the SAS Clang wrapper, so executing
```
cmake [path to project source directory]
make
```
will run all enabled SAS checks on the project's source and header files. Once this is complete, the command
```
make report_index
```
will generate an [HTML index](documentation/report_index.md) displaying the files containing coding convention violations and detailing the errors found.

# Known Issues
* When running CMake, an error
'''
You have changed variables that require your cache to be deleted.
Configure will be re-run and you may have to reset some variables.
'''
may be raised. If this occurs, add the arguments
'''
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=`which sas_check++` -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=`which sas_check`
'''
to the CMake command.

# <a id="creditAndHistory"></a> Credit and History
SAS originates from an effort within the CMS collaboration at CERN and quite some checkers were imported from CMSSW (http://cms-sw.github.io/). CMSSSW and its authors cannot be blamed by any mistake or bug present in SAS :-) The credit of single developers is preserved within the single source files. The first version of SAS was created by F. Bartek, D. Piparo and T. Hauth.

Implementation of running SAS through CMake and FCCSW naming convention checkers was carried out by David Ho in a 2016 Summer Student project under supervision of Joschka Lingemann.
